# Topics of DevOps Challenges in Developer Discussions


## DevOps Development
DevOps practices combine software development and IT (Information Technology) operations. Our continuous needs for rapid but quality software development necessitate the adoption of high quality
DevOps tools. Therefore, it is important to learn the challenges DevOps developers face while using the currently available tools and techniques. The online developer forum Stack Overflow (SO) is popular among DevOps developers. We observed a growing number of posts in SO regarding discussions. However, we are aware of no previous study that analyzed SO posts to learn the challenges DevOps developers discuss in SO.
